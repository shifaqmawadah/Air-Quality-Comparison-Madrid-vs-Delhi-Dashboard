# Air-Quality-Comparison-Madrid-vs-Delhi-Dashboard

## Introduction
Air quality is a major concern in cities worldwide due to urbanization and industrial activities. This project compares air pollution in Madrid, Spain and Delhi, India from 2015 to 2020. Using Power BI, we visualized trends in key pollutants such as PM2.5, PM10, NOx, CO, SO₂, and O₃, and classified air quality using the Air Quality Index (AQI).

The study highlights differences in air pollution levels between the two cities, helping users understand patterns, seasonal changes, and health impacts. The goal is to provide a clear and interactive way to explore air quality data and promote awareness of environmental challenges.
